# MultiVAC

Named after Isaac Asimov's recurring supercomputer, MultiVAC is a general purpose 6DOF simulation that I wrote in Rust to serve as a proving ground for new GNC methods. MultiVAC is able to simulate aircraft in-atmosphere and satellite constellations simulatenously, allowing for more precise modeling of interactions between the two.

MultiVAC is configurable via Python script, allowing for both rapid test setup and low runtime. Demonstration projects available include a reinforcement learning flight controller developed for the ATP-XW Blizzard (see below) and a satellite constellation collision avoidance scenario.

Not intended for public use. Repository has been temporarily made publically available for graduate school applications.
